# 1-1 multilingual example
An example project on how you can do 1-1 multilingual in Umbraco where a single node can have different URLs per language. It uses Vorto and Nested Content.

It's possible to choose in what language you want to preview and you can search in Vorto content. It also has some other crazy examples.

It has a Visual Studio project which you can build. After that just start the website and it should work. It comes with a SQL CE database.
